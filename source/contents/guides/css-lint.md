## Using CSS Lint

The absolute easiest way to use CSS Lint is just go to the [CSS Lint website](http://csslint.net/) and paste in your CSS. Done.

That isn't the most useful but it is easy.

What is much more useful is to install it locally. 

### Install

    npm install -g csslint

### Run

    csslint mycss.css

You can read full instructions in the [CSS Lint documentation](https://github.com/CSSLint/csslint/wiki/Command-line-interface).
