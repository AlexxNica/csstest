## Getting started

This section contains the most basic instructions you need to get a very simple automated test running to get started.

Once you have figured out which tools are most appropriate for the kind of testing you want to do, you should dig into the [Guides](/guides/).

  * [CSS Lint for syntax checks](/getting-started/css-lint-syntax-check.html)

  * [Automate anything](/getting-started/automate-anything.html)

  * Integrating into an existing build pipeline
