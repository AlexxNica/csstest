## CSSCritic

This project brings [image diff comparisons](/techniques/image-diff.html) into a familiar test-runner view. The interface makes it easy to generate and verify test cases.

Originally a Firefox-only project, command-line usage is being brought in using [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/).
