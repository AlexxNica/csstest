## Mogotest

Mogotest is a commerical service using this technique (also known as Web Consistency Testing).

They do a particularly nice job of reporting only the core mismatches between pages. If a div is 200px too low, its children would also report as 200px too low. By reporting the common parentâ€™s errors, the useful information is maximised so you can focus on fixing just the core issues.
