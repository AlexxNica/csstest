## CSSLint

An open-source project started by [Nicholas C. Zakas](http://www.nczonline.net/) and [Nicole Sullivan](http://www.stubbornella.org/). One of the most well-known CSS tools.

CSSLint is most often used for maintaining consitency with a [house style guide](/techniques/house-styleguide.html) but it can also be an easy way to integrate [syntax checking](/techniques/syntax-checks.html) into a [build pipeline](/guide/build-pipeline.html).

To integrate this into a build pipeline, your best option is probably the most well-known CSS testing tool: CSSLint as, aside from everything else it offers, it provides syntax checks. Importantly, it has great community support so there are already plugins for the most common continuous integration setups.
