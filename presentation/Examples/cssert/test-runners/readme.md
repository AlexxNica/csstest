# cssert Unit tests

A Unit testing framework obviously needs its own unit tests. 

I will get round to writing some proper Jasmine tests soon. Until then, here are a few sample test cases built from the
Twitter Bootstrap project.

These tests have been generated using the automatic test generation
bookmarklet. The file can be copied into the browser test area or the
command-line test area and run. Everything should continue to pass as
long as Twitter don't change the appearance of the elements being
tested.
