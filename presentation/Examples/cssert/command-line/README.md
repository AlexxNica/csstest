# Running command-line tests

## Installing PhantomJS
Download the right version for your system from the [PhantomJS
Repository](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/downloads/list). You can
update your path to include a reference to it or place the exectuable in
this folder. The cssert script will recognise it is here.

## Running all tests
To run all tests in the tests folder at once, simply run with no
arguments:
```
$ ./cssert
```

## Running a specific test
```
$ ./cssert testcase.html
```
